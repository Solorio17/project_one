                                                Believe it or not, the first cups of coffee we sold were out of our old home's garage here in CO.
                                                We Began receiving lots of great feedback from our close friends and family and we knew
                                                we needed to scale. With great support from rounds of funding we were able to open
                                                our first brick and mortar in 2018. It has been great to keep receiving support
                                                from our loyal customers. We love our job because you love our coffee!

                                        <p>
                                            A&J's Beans was already succesful prior to this (more here),
                                            So bear had an idea to create a partership to bring this coffee to
                                            customers' hands. We were only doing retail at the time.
                                            Anyways, bear has prior succesful business ventures and
                                            elite marketing experience so he was a key piece in the creation of
                                            bears cup. This landed him in the cover of Greatness Magazine. Bear
                                            is always looking for ways to innovate and improve our business, and
                                            creating lifelong parterships as well as build lifelong customers.

                                            A&J's Beans started in an online mom&pop shop.(Ayanna & Jason) in 2010. At
                                            first we weren't receiving the attention we hoped to get. But with
                                            the rise of social media and with bears elite marketing experience
                                            we were able to receive more and more attention and praisings from customers.
                                            Those first thousand bags were probably the most difficult to sell and produce.
                                            With our investing we opened our first mill, and we were able to hire a great
                                            team and that allowed us to being wholesale. Now we just opened our second mill
                                            last year and we hope to reach many more people.

                                            but I started to notice that I was spending far too much money everyday.
                                            I had savings from my successful beauty care salon. And decided to invest in
                                            this Idea. - Ayanna"

                                            "I must be honest before I met Ayanna I never really drank coffee. But the more
                                            time I spent time with her and with seeing all the hundreds of coffee cups I saw her
                                            drink. I eventually gave in. I also enjoy iced coffee, but I really pushed for us
                                            to have other options and thats when we introduced our refreshers. - Jason"

                                            and now all our customers. We wanted to give back too! So we deciced that with
                                            every cup of coffee sold in our stores, we would donate 10% of that sale
                                            to Our Purpose Our Earth Foundation. And another 10% to Coffee Us Co.
